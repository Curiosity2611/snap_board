# Welcome to STM32MP1 Wiki

## Overview
This documentation is on design notes/decisions used to develop snap developement boards. This documentation will be updated from time to time based on new learnings. This Wiki is designed to consolidate my knowledge into a one stop source for future refereces. That said, this Wiki is:

- Not exhaustive. 
- Constantly being updated with new information. 
- May contain some errors (will be corrected if found!)

For more information on the design goal, head to [about](about.md) page.
